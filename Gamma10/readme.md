Example of a script input file for the case of magnetic coupling constant equal to 10.

It can be used to apply a magnetic field from an initial simulation of a colloidal solution uniformly dispersed (state of the dispersion in absence of the magneic field).

Typical of the simulations reported in Figure 3 of our 2011 paper

IMPORTANT NOTES:

- To be used with the 21 May 2008 version of the LAMMPS simulation software.

- To understand the system of units please read in detail the Supporting information of our 2011 paper:
