Sample script used in our 2011 SoftMatter paper ( DOI:10.1039/C0SM01424A ) with LAMMPS program to generate an initial condition for the simulations.
This generates a system of particles in absence of external field. The run equilibrates the system in order to obtain an homogeneous system.
The run is made for 1000 particles, but the simulation box can be easily replicated to obtain larger systems for simulation of 8000 particle systems.
